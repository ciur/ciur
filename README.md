Papermerge DMS is **open source document management system** for scanned documents (PDF documents,
JPEG, PNG, TIFF scans). Its source code is split into two major pieces backend

papermerge related projects under one umbrella.

Following is the list of Papermerge ecosystem major projects:


* [Papermerge](https://github.com/ciur/papermerge) - **Meta repository**, currently used as central issues tracker, project visibility and discussions. The source code for papermerge before 2.0 used to be in this repo.
