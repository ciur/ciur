## Papermerge Ecosystem

Papermerge is **open source document management system** for scanned documents
(PDF documents, JPEG, PNG, TIFF scans). Its source code is split into many
reusable packages. Each of these packages is part of [Papermerge Organization](https://github.com/papermerge).

Following is the list and a diagram of Papermerge projects ecosystem:

* [Papermerge](https://github.com/ciur/papermerge) - Django project which bundles all pieces together
* [Papermerge Core](https://github.com/papermerge/papermerge-core) - Backend central piece. The heart of Papermerge. This is a [python package](https://pypi.org/project/papermerge-core/) (Django + Django REST API application).
* [Papermerge.JS](https://github.com/papermerge/papermerge.js) - Frontend central piece (emberjs application)
* [Documentation](https://github.com/papermerge/documentation) - Sphinx based documentation repository.
